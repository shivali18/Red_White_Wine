# Red_White_Wine
The objective of this project was to evaluate the effects of different variables on quality of wine and see if there were any variables that have a significant effect on it. My team and I also tested if the Free Sulfur Dioxide and pH level of the wine  are dependent on each other.  The data set used for this analysis had different factors that affected the quality of wine which was ranked by a panel of wine-tasting experts on a scale of 0-10 which was further categorized into Low, OK, Average, Good and Great. My teammate and I, investigated the optimum levels at which each of these variables may be set to bring the quality of the wine to the maximum using factor analysis, cluster analysis, and MANOVA on the data set..
